# Insurance Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

Insurance Fraud Detection is a Machine Learning system designed to predict whether an insurance claim is **genuine or fraudulent**.  

The system analyzes data from automobile, health, and property insurance domains, including:

- Claim amounts  
- Billing patterns  
- Damage reports  
- Customer history  
- Treatment codes  
- Claim frequency  

The goal is to flag suspicious activities, reduce financial losses, and support faster and fair decision-making.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Insurance provides financial protection against losses. However, fraudulent claims have become a major issue, causing significant losses to insurance companies.

A fraud claim occurs when:
- A claimant attempts to obtain benefits they are not entitled to, or  
- An insurer knowingly denies benefits that are due.  

The number of detected fraud cases is much lower than the actual number of fraudulent activities. Therefore, an intelligent system is required to automatically detect suspicious claims.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

- Predict whether an insurance claim is **fraudulent or legitimate**
- Improve fraud detection accuracy
- Reduce financial losses
- Automate claim verification
- Assist risk managers with data-driven decisions
