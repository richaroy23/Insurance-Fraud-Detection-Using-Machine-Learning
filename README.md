# Insurance-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Insurance Fraud Detection is a machine learning system that predicts whether insurance claims are genuine or fraudulent. It analyzes automobile, health, and property data such as claim amounts, billing patterns, damage reports, and customer history to flag suspicious activities, reduce financial losses, and support faster, fair decision making.
Insurance is made to provide a relief amount for any damage caused. Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss, but now-a-days Many people are claiming the Insurance by fraud. It can be called a scam. It is called a fraud claim when a claimant attempts to obtain some benefit or advantage they are not entitled to, or when an insurer knowingly denies some benefit that is due. These types of Insurance claims cause loss to the company. So, It is necessary to detect the claims that are fraudulent. The number of cases of insurance fraud that are detected is much lower than the number of acts that are actually committed. So the main purpose of the Insurance Fraud Detection system is to predict whether an Insurance claim is a Fraud or a legal claim based on the different appeals and parameters.

Scenario 1: Automobile Insurance Fraud Detection

Machine learning is used to analyze vehicle damage details, claim amounts, and customer history.
The system identifies suspicious auto insurance claims and classifies them as fraud or genuine.
This helps insurance companies reduce financial losses and speed up claim processing.

Scenario 2: Health Insurance Fraud Detection

The model detects fraudulent health claims by analyzing treatment codes, billing patterns, and claim frequency.
It identifies overbilling, duplicate claims, and unnecessary medical procedures.
This ensures fair payouts and prevents misuse of healthcare insurance funds.

Scenario 3: Property Insurance Fraud Detection

Machine learning evaluates property value, claim timing, and damage reports to detect fraud.
The system flags inflated or false claims related to fire, theft, or natural disasters.
This supports risk managers in making accurate and data-driven claim decisions.
